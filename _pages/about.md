Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [School of Government at the University of Birmingham](https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/persons/dafni-kalatzi-pantera). I am also affiliated with the Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government (CAIG). As part of my postdoctoral work within the [CATALYSE project](https://catalysehorizon.eu), I focus on the health impacts of climate change and try to understand whether information about them helps close the knowledge-to-action gap for accelerating climate change action.

My broader work lies between comparative politics and the political economy of climate. At its core, my work seeks to answer a key question: _What drives climate action among the societal actors essential for the transition?_ In particular, I focus on environmental behaviors of individuals, political elites, and corporations. 

I explore the motivations, incentives, and constraints that influence environmental behavior across different contexts. How do international events affect local environmental attitudes? Does information about the costs of climate inaction influence attitudes of citizens and policymakers? How does the rising salience of energy issues impact political parties' environmental positions? When do companies decide to adopt environmental measures that go beyond state requirement? By addressing these questions, I aim to contribute to a better understanding of the forces that facilitate or hinder meaningful climate action. Methodologically, I use causal inference designs (observational, experimental) and computational text analysis.
