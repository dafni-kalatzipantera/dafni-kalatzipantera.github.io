Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [School of Government at the University of Birmingham](https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/persons/dafni-kalatzi-pantera). I am also affiliated with the Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government (CAIG). I obtained my PhD in 2023 at the University of Essex. My interests lie between comparative politics and the political economy of climate. In particular, I focus on environmental behaviors of various societal actors, such as individuals, political elites, and corporations. 

My thesis concentrated on the debate around environmental salience. I have approached this issue by analyzing environmental salience of two different social actors: the public and political parties in the
European context. In particular, in the first part of the dissertation, I examined the influence of different international forces (i.e., global integration, natural disasters abroad, the COP) on peopleâ€™s environmental preferences. In the second part of the dissertation, I focused on political parties and I disentangled the salience of environmental issues among them. 

Currently, my research on environmental political behavior has taken two forms. On the one hand, I expand my interest on the role of societal actors by examining corporations' engagement -- or not -- with environmental issues. On the other hand, as a member of the [CATALYSE project](https://catalysehorizon.eu), I focus on the health impacts of climate change and try to understand whether information about it helps close the knowledge-to-action gap for accelerating climate change action.
