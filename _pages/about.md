I am a final year PhD student at the[University of Essex, Department of Government](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/kalat60502/dafni-kalatzi-pantera) and incoming Postdoctoral Research Fellow in at the [University of Birmingham, Department of International Development](https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/persons/dafni-kalatzi-pantera). I am mainly interested in studying individual environmental attitudes and corporate green commitments. My research has appeared in the European Journal of Political Research.

In my dissertation, I study the propagation of pro-environmental ideas. In particular, I examine how international forces influence individuals’ environmental attitudes, and how the domestic political system responds to this influence. Currently, and as part of my dissertation, I study the localized effect of the UN Conference of the Parties (COP) meetings on environmental attitudes. In related projects, I have focused on natural disasters, green commitments by multinational corporations, and environmental protests. 

Before joining the Department of Government at Essex, I received a Master’s degree in International Management at the Essex Business School and a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science and History at the Panteion University in Athens, Greece.
