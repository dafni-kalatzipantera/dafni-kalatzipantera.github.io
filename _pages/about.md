I am a third year PhD student at the [University of Essex, Department of Government](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/kalat60502/dafni-kalatzi-pantera). I am mainly interested in environmental politics and corporate green commitments. My research has appeared in the European Journal of Political Research.

In my dissertation, I study the diffusion of environmental attitudes among different political actors. I focus on individual participation in environmental organizations, parties' environmental platforms, and government policies. In related projects, I focus on natural disasters, green commitments by multinational corporations, and environmental protests.

Before joining the Department of Government at Essex, I received a Master's degree in International Management at the Essex Business School and a Bachelor's degree in Political Science and History at the Panteion University in Athens, Greece.
